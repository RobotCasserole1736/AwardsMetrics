# Awards Metrics

Scrapes the first event database for all awards assigned to a team since the start of FIRST

Populates the information into a .csv . Has some not great but somewhat functional restart logic

Needs to have a new file added called `secrets.py` where you define your FIRST API key. It's on the gitignore.
